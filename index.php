      I am currently a research scientist at <a href="https://research.tableau.com/">Tableau Software</a>, where I work in the area of <b>information visualization</b>. I am particularly interested in the ethical, accurate, and responsible communication of data,
      but I am also interested in graphical perception, text analytics, statistical graphics, and uncertainty visualization.

      I was a postdoc at the <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu">UW Interactive Data Lab</a> at the <a href="http://cs.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> Department of Computer Science, supervised by  <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer">Jeff Heer</a>.

      I received my PhD. from the <a href="http://cs.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> Department of Computer Sciences in August, 2015. As a PhD. student, I worked with  <a href="/~gleicher/">Michael Gleicher</a> in the <a href="http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu">UW Graphics Group</a>, where I worked in the area of  information visualization, especially in issues related to text analytics for the humanities.  In addition I was also involved with the <a href="http://dighum.wisc.edu/">Digital Humanities</a> working group.

    <p>
      My current <a href="./research.php">research interests</a> include data ethics, communicating statistics to mass audiences, and investigating biased or misleading data visualizations.
